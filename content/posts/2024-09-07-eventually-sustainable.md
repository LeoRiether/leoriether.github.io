This blogpost was inspired by this vlogbrothers video about work, good stress, bad stress, or
something like that: [I feel like I can't talk about this, but...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNw8x0TZlvQ) 

Thanks, Hank!

    The main thing I want to say here is how there's a lot of focus on having "sustainable" work.

    Sustainability in this case seems to be defined as something you can do indefinitely without 
    burning out or anything like that.

    But should we work like that? Employers sure think so. In the software industry we make a sprint
    every two weeks, during which we should always give 100% of effort and make the best work
    possible.

    Does any human work like this? Giving 100% of their effort all of the time? I'm pretty sure not.
    Efforts to make work sustainable, then, are focused on finding a threshold of effort that can be 
    held continuously for a longer amount of time â€” like spending 45% of effort every day instead of
    100%.

    Should you work like this? I, personally, *like* giving 100% of my effort every once in a while.
    I can't do it for a long period of time, but that _doesn't mean it's unsustainable!_
    It just means I shouldn't do it for a long period of time. Having periods of high-effort
    followed by lower effort and relaxation *is* sustainable, as long as those less stressful
    periods actually occur, of course.

    Changing the pace to whichever is most adequate in a period of my life is a good thing, I think.

    Most workplaces don't allow that, though, and then you're forced to work below the limit that is
    continuously-sustainable. Without many ups and downs.

    Oh, that's... basically the blogpost? I guess I have to rewrite it now? Or copy-paste?
    I can already feel my motivation sinking...
