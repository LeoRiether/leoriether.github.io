Hello there! I'm Leonardo, a software engineer by day and $CURRENT_HOBBY by night. I write mostly about technology and software in here. You can find me on GitHub ([@LeoRiether](github.com/LeoRiether/)), Matrix (@leoriether:matrix.org) and ~~please don't send me an~~ email ([riether.leonardo@gmail.com](mailto:riether.leonardo@gmail.com)) ~~I never look at emails~~
