    <p>For the longest time I didn't organize my bookmarks at all. Links were either in
an unorganized folder with various miscellaneous neighbors or inside a &quot;Imported
from Firefox&quot; folder nested inside &quot;Imported from Chrome&quot; (repeat however many
times I changed browsers in my life).</p>
<p>Worse than that, because I didn't get much use out of bookmarks I never got into
the habit of bookmarking things a lot, which reinforces the whole not getting
much use out of them.</p>
<p>At some point, however, I found <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">vimwiki</a>
and got more invested in the way I take notes. I've since moved to <a href="https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim">mkdnflow</a>,
but these tools serve the same purpose: they allow me to keep a local, easily
accessible knowledge base that's searchable, easy to backup, stored in a very
commonly accepted format! Plus, I can bind a key to open it on <code>$EDITOR</code>.</p>
<p>But the purpose of this post isn't to explain note-taking systems in general,
you can Google &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a>&quot; or watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk">Hack your brain with Obsidian.md</a>
for that, maybe even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUZ9VATeF_4">Hack Your Brain With Elaborate Coping Mechanisms</a>
while you're at it -- it's about more than just notes, but it'll be worth it I
promise. The purpose of this post is to say why I now keep my bookmarks in said
note-taking system, in a list inside a markdown file.</p>
<p>Sure, the first thing I said is that &quot;I didn't organize my bookmarks&quot; and while
throwing every article or youtube video I have a slight chance of wanting to
revisit later isn't exactly organized, a list of links in chronological order
that I can easily Ctrl+F if needed actually works quite well! All the other
benefits of a local file that's not inside a browser apply here too, making it
easy to backup and avoding the need to export/import them. Plus -- and that's a
really nice plus -- I can run a <strong>fuzzy finder</strong> in the file to find things and
I find that works much better than trying to find bookmarks elsewhere. Keybinds
help in making it easy to open the file to add a new link, but obviously
pressing Ctrl+D is easier, so I'll at least concede that point to the browsers.</p>
<p>If I do regret choosing this format one day, markdown is just so simple I could
hack a quick script to convert it to another format and call it a day. Will I
regret it? Only time will tell. Maybe I'll edit this post 2 years from now and
report back.</p>
