Let's start with the automata, shall we? \nDeterministic Finite Automata#\n\n","id":"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/floyd-warshall-regex/","title":"How Floyd-Warshall is used to convert DFAs to regexes"},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/kmp/":{"body":"Originally written in github.\nThis article assumes you already know DFAs and NFAs (including subset construction).\nYou can follow the examples and try some other ones at KMP Simulator\nThe Problem#\n\nWe want to solve the string matching problem: given two strings S and P,\nfind all substrings of S that match the pattern P. There are other uses for\nthe concepts shown here, but we'll focus on this one first.\nA Simple Solution#\n\nThere's a pretty simple NFA construction that solves this exact problem. We'll\n\"feed\" this automaton the characters of S as input, and if at any point a\nthread is at the accepting state, we'll know there's a substring that matches\nP. Let the starting state have an edge for every character of the alphabet\n(the alphabet of the automaton, not necessarily the english alphabet). This\nloop will create a thread at every input and leave it there, at the starting\nnode, ready to match the pattern when the other inputs come. Next, we'll make a\npath containing the characters of the pattern P at every edge. Here's an\nexample of an NFA that matches the pattern \"abacaba\":\n\nNotice that the Σ edge in the first node represents \"an edge for every symbol of the alphabet\", and that includes the symbol \"a\". Thus, if the automaton receives an \"a\", the thread in the first node splits into one for the second node and one that keeps looping on the starting node. When this split occurs, one of the threads will keep walking to the right while the symbols of the string are matching the forward edges, but if at any point they don't match, the thread dies. Take a moment to appreciate how this simple NFA solves the matching problem.\nAn Example#\n\nLet's look at an automaton that matches the pattern \"abaa\". The nodes filled in red represent alive threads. \n\nWe'll input the string \"abaab\" and see how the threads behave. First, let's input the letter \"a\".\n\nThe thread we had before split into two, and now the one on the right will try to walk to the right as far as it can. Now we input the second character of our string, \"b\".\n\nNothing surprising here. Let's input \"a\".\n\nNow there are 3 threads, look at them go! Now input another \"a\".\n\nNotice that the thread that was on the second node didn't have any edge to follow, so it died, but then the first node split and another thread is now at the second state. Also, we have a filled accepting state, so there's a match with the pattern \"abaa\"! One last input, \"b\".\n\nWe already have a thread matching the \"b\" from \"abaa\", even if this first \"a\" overlaps with our first match. This kind of behaviour allows us to match overlapping patterns efficiently.\nRunning the Automaton#\n\nThe naive way to run this automaton is to keep a set of threads and advance them individually. This is, however, not efficient at all. Imagine the pattern is something like \"aaaaaa\", and we match a string \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\". At every iteration a new thread would be spawned and every other thread would advance, with no deaths. This gives us a time complexity of O(|S| × |P|). We can do better by exploiting some properties.\nHow many states are reachable?#\n\nTheres' potential to do better than the naive simulation by analyzing the subset construction of our NFA. Indeed, only |P|+1 states would be reachable in it! The proof is as follows: imagine we've input some string to the automaton and there's some set of alive threads. Let u be the most advanced (closest to the right) thread alive -- we'll call it the \"leader\" thread --, and let n be the number of forward edges (the ones that aren't the loop) it followed. There are no threads to the right of u, so we only need to consider the last n symbols the automaton has seen, and there's only one length-n string possible because there's only one path the thread could have followed. Because of that, the alive threads to the left of u are uniquely determined! In other words, if we know the leader, there's only one possible set of alive threads to the left of it. With this, it's possible to conclude that there's exactly one reachable subset in the subset construction for every leader state, which gives us |P|+1 states in total.\nAn idea one could have now is: when simulating the automaton, what if we only keep track of the leader thread, instead of the entire alive subset? This is exactly what we'll do, but there's a problem: what if the leader dies? We need to know who will occupy his place. Before that, though, we'll need one more concept.\nLeft-set#\n\nIt turns out that \"there's only one possible set of alive threads to the left of the leader\" does not apply exclusively to the leader. In fact, if we know some thread is alive, all of the threads to the left of it can be uniquely determined. The argument is very similar to the one shown before, here's a sketch: if a thread is alive in node n, then there's one possible string of length n that must have been fed to the automaton in the last n steps, thus the threads in smaller positions must have come from this string.\nNow we can finally know what to do in the case of a failed match.\nDealing with failure#\n\nSuppose we've built the automaton for \"abababax\" and fed \"abababa\" to it. \n\nWhat would happen if we input the letter \"b\"? Well, the leader can't go forward, so it dies. The thread immediately to the left of the leader, however, can go forward, and thus becomes the new leader. We'll call this \"thread immediately to the left of a thread\" the \"neighbor\". This idea outlines a possible efficient way of simulating our NFA. We'll keep track of the leader at every step. How? There are two cases:\n\nThe leader matches the input and goes forward. This case is easy, just increment the current leader.\nThe leader fails to match and dies. Then, the neighbor of the leader (call him n0) may or may not survive. If it does, the new leader is n0+1. If it dies, then maybe the neighbor of n0 (call him n1) survives. If it does, the new leader is n1+1. If it dies, then maybe the neighbor of n1 survives. You get the idea. If we could know the neighbor of a thread in O(1), the entire matching process would take time O(|S|). Yes, even if we walk through neighbors one by one as they die, the algorithm runs in linear time. To see why, consider that we spawn at most one thread per step, so the total number of dead threads is bounded by |S|. It's like pushing threads to a queue when they are spawned and popping the queue when they die.\n\nPrecalculating the Neighbor#\n\nWhen building our automaton, we'll precalculate an array int neighbor[N],\nwhere neighbor[u] indicates the neighbor of u, in the case where u is the\nleader. If we do that, we'll be able to simulate our automaton as described in\n\"Dealing with failure\" in O(|S|)!\nIt turns out precalculating the neighbor is very similar to what we've seen in\n\"Dealing with failure\". Let's compute the neighbor array from left to right.\nSuppose we've already computed the result for the first k vertices. How do we\ncompute it for k+1? The only way the leader could move from k to k+1 is\nto go through the edge between them, right?\n\n\n\n","id":"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/kmp/","title":"An Alternative Interpretation for the KMP Algorithm"},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/law-of-values/":{"body":"Stated somewhat abstractly, the Law of Values says that\n\nOnce you define your core values, your most primordial beliefs and priorities, most\nof the design follows immediately\n\nHere are concrete variations:\n\nOnce you define the core values to be prioritized in a project, most of the solution\nfollows immediately.\nOnce you define what you value in a city, most of its architecture and and\ninfrastructure characteristics follow immediately\nOnce you define what you value in a society, most of your political and economic beliefs\nfollow immediately\nOnce you define what you value in life, most of your actions and objectives should\nfollow immediately\n\nThe law is useful in two ways. I'll use a software engineering context here, but it's not\ntoo hard to translate these into other contexts as well:\nFirst, it can be helpful to state explicitly what you value to get more clarity about\nwhat you should and shouldn't put in a project design --- instead of purely exploring\ndesign alternatives directly.\nYou can see matklad doing just that in this TigerBeetle video.\nFor TigerBeetle, some of the core tenets of the solution are Reliability and Correctness.\nBecause of the Reliability tenet, it soon follows that Performance should be a major\nconcern as well, which leads to the choice of language (Zig in their case), a big part of\ntheir data model, the kind of operations the interface exposes, and a lot of other design\ndecisions.\nSecond, there's a kind of contrapositive of the law: different designs follow from\ndifferent sets of values. Because of this, whenever a team disagrees on the direction a\nproject should take, it can be more fruitful to discuss \"what should we value/prioritize\nin this project\" instead of the direction itself. For example, if some members believe a\nsystem should be monolithic, while others think it should be distributed, instead of\ndiscussing pros and cons of monolithic and distributed systems, it can be easier to reach\nan agreement by defining \"Fault-Tolerance\" as a core value of the project (or the\nopposite). Once that's defined, it's clear that the system should be distributed.\nNote that there's a fundamental difference between discussing pros/cons and discussing\ncore values. In the above example, even though fault-tolerance could be listed as a pro of\nthe \"distributed\" alternative, by listing it separately we get a better chance to make it\na top priority (or the opposite!).\nPlus, if there's disagreement on whether it should be a top priority or not but the\ndiscussion is pros/cons-oriented, it's inevitable someone will say \"distributed is\nfault-tolerant!\", to which the response will be \"but the monolith is simpler and easier to\ndeploy!\", leading to a standstill.

I'll\nalso give a brief introduction to each technique as motivation, but I expect the\nreal value of this post to be the links contained in it.\nBefore delving into more specific techniques, it's worth mentioning How to Test\nby matklad, as it contains a wealth of information, techniques and practices.\nIf I had to pick only one link to recommend, it would be this one. Many of the\nother sections will overlap with How to Test.\nSo with that out of the way, let's talk about...\nExample testing#\n\nOne of the easiest and most common ways of testing: come up with some example\ninputs and check if the output of a method is as expected. \n\nOne variation of this method is table-driven testing, or data-driven testing. As\nfar as I know (and I have no source for this), this technique was popularized by\nGo (see https://go.dev/wiki/TableDrivenTests), but is also recommended in How to Test -- Data Driven Testing\nand has a similar implementation in JUnit's @ParameterizedTests (see\nhttps://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests).\nIn my opinion, Go's implementation of table-driven tests is still the best.\nBecause the built-in testing library makes it easy to create subtests, you can\nwrite something like this:\n\nNotice we start the subtest with a description in t.Run(description, ...).\nIf this test fails, that description is reported in the failure message, making\nit easy to find which test failed! This is a pain point reported in How to Test:\n\nBut there’s a drawback as well — without literal #[test] attributes,\nintegration with tooling suffers. For example, you don’t automatically get “X\nout of Y tests passed” at the end of test run.\n\nIndeed, in Rust's standard testing lib, there's no way to run subtests and have\nthem reported neatly, unfortunately.\nSnapshot testing#\n\nAlso known as golden tests or expect tests, snapshot testing is example-based\ntesting with a twist. When a snapshot test breaks, instead of manually fixing\nthe expected values there's a mode of running the tests that updates the\nexpectations based on the real outputs, potentially saving you a lot of time.\nAlthough matklad recommends this technique in How to Test -- Expect-Tests,\nI'll be using the (very recent!) library selfie, which\nruns in the JVM, for an example. With selfie, you'd write a test like this\n(blatantly stolen from their frontpage):\n\nWhen running the test, selfie recognizes the _TODO() invocation and replaces\nit in your own files by\n\nOf course, you still need to verify that the output is really what you want. If\nthat prime list contained a 42 in the middle and no one noticed, the tests\nwould pass anyway, but that's why it's called snapshot testing: the expectation\ncaptures a snapshot of primesBelow(100) and if it ever changes we'll be\nnotified by a failing test.\nSelfie also supports saving the expected string in a file, as well as some more\nadvanced features which are less common in the snapshot testing libraries I've\nseen. The facets page exemplifies one of those.\nIn Go land, it's more common to see this pattern of testing named as \"golden\nfiles\". I'm not sure if the naming influences the implementations or the\nopposite, but indeed it's less common to see \"inline\" expectations such as\n.toBe(\"[list of primes...]\"). Instead, libraries such as\ngoldie always store expected strings in a\n(golden) file. This makes sense for longer strings, but I think this approach\nmakes it harder to review the correctness of the output, given that it's always\nin another file.\nModel-based Testing#\n\nA characteristic of example and snapshot-based testing is that they require that\nthe expected output of the program is \"hardcoded\" into the test. Because this\nrequires hand-crafting expectations, this can be impractical, especially when\nthe output is complex or hard to verify.\nIn some situations, we can implement another version of the program that does\nthe same thing but implemented in an easier way (a model), perhaps with\ndifferent performance characteristics, and compare the outputs of the two\nprograms.\nFor example, to test an optimizing compiler, one could implement a much simpler\ninterpreter and verify for various inputs that both compiled and interpreted\nprograms produce the same output. \nAlthough I haven't read much on model-based testing,\nProperty-Based Testing Against a Model of a Web Application\nseems like a good starting point.\nProperty Testing#\n\nExample, snapshot and model-based tests all need a test oracle: the expected\noutput needs to be known and compared against the real one. This approach has\nsome limitations, of course, because the expected output is a lot of times too\nbig, complex or hard to generate. Property testing is the first way I'll\nintroduce of testing without an oracle!\nThe idea here is to come up with a kind of \"mathematical\" property of the system\nunder test, and check if the property holds for the inputs (these are often\nrandomly generated).\nFor example, suppose we're writing a UUID library. UUIDs have a ToString\nmethod, but we also wrote a FromString function. It makes sense, then, to\ntest that calling ToString and then FromString should yield the original\nUUID, a sort of \"inversibility\" or \"round-tripness\" property. This is by far the\nmost commonly cited property, it can be tricky to find others!\nF# for Fun and Profit has\nan entire series on property-based testing,\nwhich covers the topic quite well, from the basics to ways of finding new\nproperties.\nA talk that's pretty specific to Rust, but nonetheless very interesting is\nProperty-testing async code in Rust to build reliable distributed systems\nby Antonio Scandurra. In it, Antonio explains how Zed\nwraps the async executor in test code to randomize the order of concurrent\ntasks, thus covering cases that would be much harder to trigger otherwise,\nalso making the concurrency deterministic (randomized with a known seed) in\nthe process (actually, I'm not sure it's fully deterministic? Not sure about\nthis part, please go watch the video :).\nSurprisingly (for me at least), Go's standard testing library has a\nproperty-testing framework called testing/quick,\nbased on Haskell's QuickCheck.\nIn Go's version, you write a func (x Input) bool and the library generates\nvalues of x to try and make it return false, in which case the test would\nfail.\nMetamorphic Testing#\n\nMetamorphic testing is actually a flavor of property testing, a subset of ways\nyou could pick a property. This technique relies on generating inputs like\nin property tests, then modifying it in a way that we know what should change in\nthe output. For example, suppose we're testing a StableSort function. If we\nshuffle the input, the output should not change at all, but if we concatenate\nthe input to itself (e.g. [1, 2, 3] =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]), the output will be\ninterspersed with itself (e.g. [1, 2, 3] =&gt; [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]).\nMetamorphic Testing by Hillel Wayne\ngives great examples of the technique and links some academic papers, if you're\ninto that. Unfortunately, it does not link Cross-Branch Testing,\nalso by Hillel Wayne, about a method that could be considered snapshot testing,\nmodel-based testing, property testing and metamorphic testing all at once! In\nshort, the idea consists in using another git branch as a model and checking the\nproperty thing(X) == thing_from_another_branch(X). Kind of like a snapshot!\nWeird Tests#\n\nSurely this can't be the only term used for these kinds of tests, but Use weird tests to capture tacit knowledge\nuses it and so will I.\nWeird tests test things you wish were true in your codebase, but are not\nenforced by any other tooling. matklad explains it better than I could in Basic Things -- Not Rocket Science Rule:\n\nMaintain a well-defined set of automated checks that pass on the main branch\nat all times. If you don’t want large blobs in git repository, write a test\nrejecting large git objects and run that right before updating the main\nbranch. No merge commits on feature branches? Write a test which fails with a\npageful of Git self-help if one is detected. Want to wrap .md at 80 columns?\nWrite a test :)\nIt is perhaps worth you while to re-read the original post:\nhttps://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html\nThis mindset of monotonically growing set of properties that are true about\nthe codebase is incredibly powerful. You start seeing code as temporary, fluid\nthing that can always be changed relatively cheaply, and the accumulated set\nof automated tests as the real value of the project.\n\nNote: matklad calls \"weird tests\" the \"not rocket science rule\", but I don't get\nthe impression these are the same things from the original NRSR post? I'll\ncontinue calling them weird tests :)\nThese are a great way of \"documenting\" processes and standards in a given\nproject! It helps both new team members and veterans that may have forgotten a\nthing or two.\nAs a side note, I think running linters and format-checkers could be considered\n\"weird tests\" as well. These are standard practice, why not make your own lints\nas well?\nFormal Methods#\n\nSo you like property testing, but worry that the random test cases might miss\nsomething? Why not mathematically prove those properties instead, then? Formal\nmethods allow us to verify properties for all inputs, without actually running\nthe program! A lot of effort has been put into making this kind of technique\nmore mainstream, but it hasn't really catched on, unfortunately.\nOne way of writing these proofs is with languages that implement\ndependent typing, like Coq, Agda, Idris and Kind.\nTypes in these languages can encode proofs, so in some cases you don't even need\nto write a test, instead choosing to return a type that proves the test would\npass (if it doesn't pass, it doesn't compile!). A big barrier to entry for\ndependent typing is that you need to use these very specific languages to get\nthe benefit, you can't just go get a \"dependent types library\" to start using\nit in a Go application that already exists, you have to write that application\nfrom scratch in Agda or something. Kind1 actually compiled\nto JS, so you could make it work for some real-life applications, but this seems\nto not be the case in the current version of Kind. I guess Kind compiles to C,\nso you should be able to embed it in other stuff, but few people bother.\nAnother kind of formal method are SMT Solvers, such as the Z3 Theorem Prover,\nused by Dafny. In Dafny, you can specify\npreconditions, postconditions, loop invariants and more, then given\nenough information the compiler will automatically prove the constraints for\nyou, or give a counter-example. I haven't used SMT solvers myself, so I can't\nsay much here, but I think the overall idea is pretty cool. Again, though, the\ncode you want to prove needs to be written in Dafny if you want to prove things\nwith it, even if it does compile to a bunch of languages (currently C#, Go,\nPython, Java and JavaScript). \nShould You Really Write That Test?#\n\nHopefully I've shown you some new and shiny testing techniques in this post and\nyou're now eager to try them all, get 100% coverage on every git repo you've\never touched and spend the next few years fixing all those bugs you've found!\nCalm down there, I don't hope that at all. In fact, I like the takes by Brandon\nSmith in Thoughts on Testing.\nAs highlighted in the post, tests have to be maintained just like the rest of\nthe code in your codebase. It can be easy to add tests for the sake of adding\nthem, but this can do more harm than good. Tests that just mirror the\nimplementation, for example, can end up needing a lot of maintenance without\nadding much benefit at all.\nAnother good post is Testing on the Toilet: Testing State vs. Testing Interactions\non the Google Testing Blog. The second test in it is an example of a test that\ncan give a false sense of security because even though the code is technically\ntested, an incorrect implementation would still pass. \nTest Scoping#\n\nIt's common to restrict the scope of what you're testing by replacing\ndependencies with fakes, stubs or mocks.\nAs supported by Thoughts on Testing and (again) How to Test, tests with a\nreally small scope (many unit tests fall into this category) tend to test very\nlittle, but the amount of tests you write is large, increasing maintenance\nburden while providing less security and confidence in the code. A good idea\nseems to be Testing at the boundaries,\nalongside Testing Features, Not Code.\nThis keeps the implementation flexible and the public API more rigid.\nSome people will argue for the complete opposite side of the discussion and\ndefend unit tests that mock everything, but I am not one of them, you'll have to\nfind the resources for this on your own.\nConclusion#\n\nThe main takeaway of this article is that you should read How to Test\nand other posts by matklad – highly recommend Basic Things as well.\nAside from that, we've discussed testing techniques that require a test oracle,\nlike example-based, snapshot and model-based testing; as well as techniques that\ndon't, such as property, metamorphic and cross-branch testing.\nThese are good methods to apply to test the behavior of code, but you can test\nproperties of the code itself as well! Like custom linters, weird tests verify\nthat everyone is following a convention, or hasn't forgotten to add a thing\nwhere it needs to be added, or didn't commit a typo in the docs, etc etc. These\ntests can aid in knowledge distribution (if you break a test, it may specify the\nway to fix it) and eases cognitive load (the tests can remind you of how to do\nthings). \nBut sometimes the best test is no test at all! Some tests do more harm than\ngood and can give you a false sense of security while simultaneously making the\ncodebase harder to maintain. By testing features and system boundaries, it's\neasier to maintain software that does what it's supposed to while minimizing\nfriction for extension and modification.\nAnd that's it, folks! Happy testing :)\n","id":"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/tests-literature-review/","title":"Testing Resources — A Literature Review"},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/the-relational-model-had-it-all-figured-out/":{"body":"This is a post about the Zen of Python, system boundaries, software design, relational databases,\nECS, and how everything became connected when I realized the mistake I made at work.\nThe main character is a gRPC API, who we'll call Bob so as not to reveal real details. Bob\ninternally manages entities called Trees. We don't want to complicate it right now, so every\nTree has exactly one Branch, and that's it. How does a user of the API retrieve existing\nTrees? Simple:\n\nGreat! Let's write some others methods to create and update trees (which we\nwon't discuss here), implement everything and then publish the API so everyone\nuses it!\nWe're storing trees on Postgres, the queries are really easy:\n\nNow that we're done, there's a new requirement: every branch can now have multiple leaves. Because\nof the big amount of leaves though, GetAllTrees should not return any leaves. Users of\nGetAllTrees don't need to know about the leaves and it would waste too much network. GetTree,\nhowever, should return the leaves. How do we change the gRPC interface to reflect that? Adding a\nrepeated Leaf leaves = 3; on the Branch message won't work because GetAllTrees uses it. I\nguess we could wrap a Branch with another message that also includes leaves? How does that look?\n\nWait, how do we modify GetTree? There's no way to put BranchWithLeaves as a field in Tree\nbecause it would affect GetAllTrees! Scrap that idea... Maybe put the leaves directly in the\nGetTreeResponse?\n\nAh, nice, that works! No breaking change needed, users are unaffected, job done.\nBut what's that, right around the corner? Another requirement!? Now a tree can have many branches.\nOk... Tree needs to change... But it's easy to make at least, the users can continue using\nmain_branch until they migrate to branches:\n\nNow to update GetTree. Remember that the response looked like this:\n\nThe tree has a list of branches, and every branch has a list of leaves,\ntherefore we should add...\n\nYeah... That doesn't look like a pleasant API to use at all. Branches are nested within the Tree,\nbut leaves are outside (by necessity!) and iterating over this structure requires keeping track of\nindices and is harder than it should be.\nIn fact, to add another \"optional\" nesting level -- like leaves that have cells but only in another\nroute -- it would be necessary to add a list of list of list of cells in the GetTreeResponse,\nunless there's another approach that's not equally bad and I'm missing.\nWhere did I go wrong? Could I have prevented this? It was at this moment I realized... I literally\nsaw this video yesterday and in the first minute,\nwhen the guy says \"Flat is better than nested\" when referring to a principle of the Zen of Python, I\nthought I understood what he meant, but now, only now I truly understood! The problem above only\narises because Branch is nested within the Tree message! When making that decision, I implicitly\nrequired that Tree contained not only the current Branch, but everything a Branch would ever\ncontain, today's and tomorrow's fields.\nHow can a flat structure help? Let's go back to the beginning, before those new requirements, the\ntimes when a Tree could only have a single Branch and leaves didn't exist. Here's the alternative\ndesign for the responses:\n\nThe TreeBranchPair message is a bit ugly, sure, but I blame protobuf for this, capn'proto has a\ncleaner way of defining it.\nIs this any harder to use than our first design? Not really, trees and branches are still right next\nto each other, easily iterable in GetAllTreesResponse, without adding any cognitive load. There's\nmore code, yes, but it's still simple.\nLet's add the next requirement: a branch has multiple leaves, but GetAllTrees shouldn't include\nthem. Sure!\n\nThat's it! GetAllTreesResponse doesn't change at all. Could we nest repeated Leaf inside the\nBranch? Sure we could, but we've seen how that can lead to problems down the line, and the current\nstructure seems perfectly fine, no? \nGreat, let's try the final test: adding multiple branches per tree. There's no way to do this\nwithout deprecating some things as far as I'm aware, but it's possible to update the responses like\nthis:\n\nWe did it! The structure is a bit hard to visualize in protobuf, but this is the schema:\n\nI think that's much better :)\nPlus, this design is a ton more flexible. Imagine some new route doesn't care about branches at all,\nonly about trees and it's leaves. It's easy to define it like this:\n\nBut notice we didn't sacrifice today's simplicity to accomodate for tomorrow's vague and fuzzy\npossibilities. It's simple whether OnlyTreesAndLeavesPlease is added or not.\nAnother point here is that the only nesting that exists in these messages occurs because of repeated\nitems. If a tree could only have one branch, which in turn could only have one leaf, the structure\nwould be completely flat, like this:\n\nSide note: once all clients update their code to remove deprecated fields, we can reserve them,\ncleaning the protobuf code up.\nOne caveat of this approach is that you always need to define all of the entities (trees, branches,\nleaves) that will be returned, leading to more code repetition. In my case, I think it was a well\nworthwhile tradeoff, but your mileage may vary.\n\nI'd like to interlude for a moment to talk about system boundaries and software design. Ted\nKaminski describes it in detail in System boundaries: the focus of design,\nbut I'll give an overview.\nWhy am I writing this long rant about a design mistake instead of just fixing it?

If you don't use vim macros yet or would\nlike to learn more, I definitely recommend watching\nThat One Micro Talk on Macros (NeovimConf 2023) by Jesse Leite.\nIn the video, Jesse introduces this wonderful mapping:\n\nOk, that was for neovim. In vimscript, it's\n\nAnd that's it! The most important mapping in my config! It just runs the macro\nq and goes down a line. Honestly I'm thinking about changing it to map to\n@q only and it would still be the most important mapping in my config. Let me\nexplain.\nThe Problems With Macros#\n\nIt's common to hear people talking about how powerful vim macros are, but I\nalways thought they were too clunky. It's easy to make a macro that will do\nunexpected things when replayed and @q/@@ are so awkward to type. This lead\nme to search for alternatives like dot-repeating and substitution with :s, but\nthese only work in simple cases and can be repetitive.\nThe Solution#\n\nThen, everything changed when NeovimConf published the talk. Only Jesse Leite,\nmaster of all macros, could teach us, and when the world needed him most, he was\nthere. Q doesn't only reduce the barrier to replay a macro, it completely\ndestroys it. It's impressive how much cheaper macros become when they're so\nspammable!\nI also started getting much better at making macros that do well on replays, not\nbecause Q changes anything fundamentally, but because I was getting a lot more\npractice.\nSince I began using Q, I've used macros in a number of interesting\nscenarios, including:\nTransforming gRPC service definitions into Go functions#\n\nSuppose I had a gRPC service like the one below\n\nTo implement this service in Golang, I copied the 4 lines of rpcs (it was more\nlike 7 in the real case) into a .go file and recorded a macro, turning it into\n\nFor the other three functions, the macro does its job\n\nWriting the gRPC service example above#\n\nThat whole service definition is very repetitive! I actually initially wrote\n\nRecorded a macro to modify the first rpc into\n\nand replayed the macro for the other 3 rpcs, remembering to yank the first word\nto paste before ThingRequest and ThingResponse.\nAdding a property to certain items in a yaml#\n\nIn another case, I had a huge yaml and needed to modify about 30 list items by\nadding a new flag: true property to them. For this, I opened two buffers\nside-by-side -- yaml on the left, a list of IDs that should be modified on the\nright. The macro starts on the right, hovering the current ID, then goes to the\nleft, searches and modifies an item and goes back to the right. By pressing Q\nmultiple times, we jump around the yaml making changes one by one, but always\ngoing back to the next ID on the list!\nMaybe this could be done using the quickfix list as well, but the macro is so\nsimple I would probably do it this way again, if I need.\nCaveats#\n\nI argue macros are much more convenient after mapping Q to @qj, but they\ncan still feel clunky and hard to use, mostly because of replayability issues.\nIt does get better with practice, but there's definitely a learning curve. For\nthose of you who swear by multiple cursors, I'll give you that: they're much\neasier to use. Oh and there's no \"preview\" for macros! If you get it wrong,\nyou'll only know after recording and you'll have to record again.\nUsing the right text-objects does make a big difference, though, because it can\nmake motions more \"generic\". I find that\nchrisgrieser/nvim-various-textobjs\nhas been very useful in that regard.\nConclusion#\n\nWatch That One Micro Talk on Macros (NeovimConf 2023),\nmap Q to @qj and be happy.\n","id":"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/vim-macros/","title":"The Most Important Vim Mapping (it just runs a macro)"}},"docInfo":{"https://leoriether.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://leoriether.github.io/about/":{"body":26,"title":0},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/floyd-warshall-regex/":{"body":53,"title":6},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/kmp/":{"body":664,"title":4},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/law-of-values/":{"body":231,"title":2},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/plaintext-bookmarks/":{"body":224,"title":4},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/small-to-large/":{"body":308,"title":5},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/test/":{"body":209,"title":2},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/tests-literature-review/":{"body":1366,"title":4},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/the-relational-model-had-it-all-figured-out/":{"body":532,"title":5},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/trees/":{"body":336,"title":4},"https://leoriether.github.io/posts/vim-macros/":{"body":356,"title":5}},"length":13},"lang":"English"};
